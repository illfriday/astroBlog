## Examining Dead Zones in my life

In my last [post](./post-5), I expressed some of my fears about finding my Purpose. I also mentioned picking up a book that freaked me out a little, **Claim Your Power** by Mastin Kipp. I have decided to start the 40 day program ,because why not? It will at least lead to some meaningful self-reflection. In that spirit, here goes nothing...

**These included:**

- Am I meant to be a coder? Should I put in the effort to learn?
- I'm worried I don't know enough and will fail or embarrass myself.
- I'm afraid I will let my son down if I never become great at one thing.
- I will never have everything figured out.
- I am afraid to commit to my Purpose.
- I am afraid to walk through life without ever finding my Purpose.

I am going to use these fears as a jumping off point to examine the concept of Dead Zones in my life. These areas contribute to the feeling of being stuck, or "dead". Allowing these areas to remain dead contributes to a feeling of not being alive fully.

### Career

- **What Survival Patterns have kept you from admitting you were dead in the past?**
  - Confusion
  - Playing small
  - Addiction
  - Fear of failure
  - Procrastination
  - Needing the approval of others
- **When was the first time you felt dead in this area?**
  - I want to say I have always felt dead in this area, but I truly became lost when I gave up on being a professional artist. I have set up many blocks to finding my purpose in this arena.
    - Not feeling like a part of capitalist society
    - Not wanting to "sell out"/ be commercial
    - Wanting to die young
    - Not thinking about the future
- **How has remaining dead in this area contributed to your survival?**
  - Feeling like I don't have my career figured out has allowed mt to choose an easy path that allowed me to continue with self-medicating addicted behaviors. I sought to avoid the pain of failure by avoiding commitment. This has, however, allowed me to have some good experiences and find a career that potentially supports my creativity(though the reality has been somewhat lacking historically).
- **Are there any relationships in your life that support you remaining dead in this area?**
  - My current job would like to keep me, so this supports me not moving on. However, this is mostly my own doing and my supervisors are generally supportive of what I want to do. In the past, my parents have provided a supportive environment intended to be liberating, but having the opposite effect of allowing me not to be realistic about career choices.

### Creativity/Artistic Practice

- **What Survival Patterns have kept you from admitting you were dead in the past?**
  - Perfectionism
  - Playing small
  - Addiction
  - Procrastination
  - Confusion
  - Putting myself last
- **When was the first time you felt dead in this area?**
  - I felt I had to admit to myself I was dead as an artist in the mid aughts. I was driving myself to depression through a combination of procrastination and confusion. This led to a reliance on alcohol to numb the feeling I was letting down my higher self.
- **How has remaining dead in this area contributed to your survival?**
  - I could not take the pain of being depressed and unable to realize my unfairly high standards of being an artist. I was told most artists wouldn't make it and I couldn't match the artist peers I knew in terms of sustained effort. Shutting this area of my life down allowed me to live, but cut me off from what I considered to be my core identity.
- **Are there any relationships in your life that support you remaining dead in this area?**
  - Difficult question, but I guess I'm feeling my current job is a little bit stifling lately. The trust of my artistic vision seems lacking. I hate to say it, but having an infant son is difficult in terms of finding time for things for myself. Adding "putting myself last" to the list of SP's.

### Romantic Relationship

- **What Survival Patterns have kept you from admitting you were dead in the past?**
  - Putting myself last
  - Playing small
  - Addiction
- **When was the first time you felt dead in this area?**
  - Around the time when I started drinking a lot to bury my feelings of frustration about my artistic process being dead. I felt like I was in an easy relationship with a less than observant partner. It would be easy to continue with the relationship in my addicted state.
- **How has remaining dead in this area contributed to your survival?**
  - Lately, the time required by my other commitments makes this area easy to de-prioritize. In the past, this relationship has given me a set of external goals and commitments that would move my life along without me having to create my own plan/find my Purpose.
- **Are there any relationships in your life that support you remaining dead in this area?**
  - I think my partner has allowed, if not encouraged, this complacent attitude. I don't know if she sees it because sometimes I play along. There are lots of benefits to remaining in the relationship for both parties, so a deep co-dependency has developed over a long time. Neither of us have a lot of time to devote to the romantic side of things currently, so we exist in a supportive, but uninspired state of love. Seems more platonic than anything...

### Commitment/Goals

- **What Survival Patterns have kept you from admitting you were dead in the past?**
  - Confusion
  - Doubting my higher wisdom
  - Addiction
  - Perfectionism
  - Playing small
  - Fear of failure
- **When was the first time you felt dead in this area?**
  - I feel like this is a muscle that is underdeveloped and atrophied. This probably has it's roots in the beginnings of my depression (teenage years, mid-90's) and the anti-social stance I took as a young person. The substance use I experimented with to deal with my anxiety and deprtession was frowned upon by authority. Therefore, I was positioned against authority as an all-knowing teenager. Therefore, I had no interest in participating in "normal" society. Never want a 9 to 5, want to go out young. Nihilist, Fatalist. I put up defense mechanisms, excuses and high walls very early.
- **How has remaining dead in this area contributed to your survival?**
  - It has allowed me to escape the anxiety of choosing a career. I believed I couldn't avoid the hard work and the pain of failures and setbacks by not choosing. This has the obvious drawbacks of limited options and choices made by others.
- **Are there any relationships in your life that support you remaining dead in this area?**
  - My family has unwittingly supported this by sheltering me to some degree. No one really was able to give me the push I needed, but i believe my fear of change would have had me kicking and screaming to stay stuck. So, I certainly haven't made it easy on my loved ones to offer help. I'm great at shutting down ideas.

### Money & Success

- **What Survival Patterns have kept you from admitting you were dead in the past?**
  - Confusion
  - Doubting my higher wisdom
  - Addiction
  - Playing small
  - Fear of failure
- **When was the first time you felt dead in this area?**
  - This is very related to the above detailing my fear of commitment and not wanting to participate in what I see as a very flawed and unjust society. During my teenage years I decided I wanted to opt out, but I never had the courage to truly try to do it. As in, moving to another country with different values, becoming a monk, becoming homeless and wandering freely (how romantic...).
- **How has remaining dead in this area contributed to your survival?**
  - It has allowed me to settle for less and get by with very little. I believed the path of poverty was intrinsic to an artist's experience. Money and the hoarding of it was inherently evil. This belief allowed me to move through life without developing skills around saving, managing and earning money. This allowed me to create the excuse not to learn these things (which no one teaches you when you are young).
- **Are there any relationships in your life that support you remaining dead in this area?**
  - My family supported this by paying for a college degree that I wasn't mature enough to appreciate. My partner supports this by financially supporting me to some degree. I want to be careful here however, because I do feel like my contributions to the relationship are necessary, important and at least equal-ish.
