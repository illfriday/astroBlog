# Serendipity

Today some things worked out in terms of timing. I was in tune with the all. Very simple stuff, but knowing when to go inside and be ready in the shower to clean up a freshly soiled baby. Meeting a local aquaintance by chance I'd been wondering about recently and having an intimate conversation. Walking into a storytime that kept my son entertained for a solid hour. For some reason the lady set off the most amazing bubble machine INSIDE the LIBRARY. Lol. Little man was trippin'.

## Not to mention deploying a real webiste quickly
