## What is My Purpose VS. This is My Purpose!

I've been having a really hard time struggling to find my "Purpose" in life. This has always been a difficult conundrum for me. How can I define the steps to success (happiness) in finding my Purpose as a human without knowing what that purpose is? I've been afraid to commit and set goals for so long, using the not knowing as an excuse.

### What would it look like if I approached every act as if it were my Purpose?

I think it's part of our life here to remain in mystery. We will not be able to see the long view of the road before us. The way is foggy. Taking each step along the way as part of our reason to be alive opens up pathways to find unexpected value in each encounter or experience. I will try to approach my experience with the faith that what I am currently doing is my Purpose. The alternative has been to discount the value of my experience by believing that I don't know my Purpose. This is integral to us, inherently a part of us. The only way forward is to unlock this knowledge. What can the daily experiences of life teach us about the path ahead?

### Claim Your Power

I was looking for another book about a Yogi's perspective on joy at the library when I stumbled upon **Claim Your Power** by Mastin Kipp. Checking this book out of the library actually scared me. I was so close to putting it back on the cart of items to be reshelved. It deals with this kind of work and presents a 40 day program to unlock one's inner knowledge of Purpose. It seems a bit of out of left field to follow this path and I am not fully committed at this point, but something about picking up the book felt a bit powerful. The author states that you probably wouldn't be picking up this book if your life was going great. He's got a point. My life is going great, but I have a hard time seeing it. Sometimes, I wish I was somewhere (someone) else.

A lot of fear is preventing me from committing to living a fully realized life. I want to know if I'm meant to be a coder before putting in the effort to learn how. I'm worried I don't know enough and will fail or embarrass myself. I'm afraid I will let my son down if I never become great at one thing and have everything figured out. Thus I am afraid to find my Purpose and afraid to walk through life without ever finding it.
