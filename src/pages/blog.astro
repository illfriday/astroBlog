    <p>
      This is a blog to document my coding journey. I'm building this blog in
      Astro. Astro is a lightweight javascript framework. I will use React in
      conjunction with Astro, but Astro can be used in conjunction with other jS
      libraries like Svelte or Angular. You can even use more than one in the
      same project. Cool, but why? This can help if you are trying to migrate
      from one library/framework to another on an existing site. This way parts
      of the site can be updated, but nothing will be left behind from the old
      code base during the update process.

      Astro uses server side rendering, but can also handle dynamic
      functionality such as logged in users. I was using 11ty SSG(static site
      generator) on my first version, interacting with Strapi headless CMS. i
      was having trouble figuring out how to effectively send POST requests to
      my Strapi generated REST API from the static site. There were ways around
      this, including using existing tools like disqus. After working and
      reading for awhile on this, the tools I was using didn't seem appropriate
      for the feature I was trying to add. I decided to give this a try and
      hopefully, I can link in the existing work I did on the CMS side.
